> [!TIP]
> **tldr:** submit issues, not PRs

Please feel free to submit issues to describe bugs or feature requests.

Keep it consise, but clear. Examples are good, like screenshots or logs.

Avoid using agents to generate issues. They tend to ramble and make it harder to understand the core problem.

## Why not PRs?

I've used Copilot heavily to generate the code so far. The planning documents like [REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md)
help ensure that it adheres to guidelines. However the code is not factored in a way that I feel would be productive
to edit directly for most changes at this time.

As this matures I'll evaluate how to better structure code for the long-term, but at least for the moment just
submitting clear feedback through issues is likely to be more productive.
